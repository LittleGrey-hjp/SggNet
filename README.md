## üìù Overview

SggNet is a lightweight and efficient network for ORSI-SOD, achieving:
- **Parameters**: 2.70M
- **FLOPs**: 1.38G
- **Inference Speed**: 108 FPS

It demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight ORSI-SOD methods, delivering accurate saliency detection, sharper boundaries, and clearer activation maps.
