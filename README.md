# SggNet: A Lightweight Semantic- and Graph-Guided Network for Advanced Optical Remote Sensing Image Salient Object Detection (Under Review)

Thank you for your interest in **SggNet**, a novel lightweight network designed for salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs). This repository provides part of the code for SggNet. The full implementation and key components will be made available after the paper completes the peer-review process.

## üö® Notice

-> The paper presenting SggNet is currently **under review**. To preserve the integrity of the review process, only partial code is being shared at this stage. The full implementation, including essential model details, will be released upon acceptance. Stay tuned for 
-> updates!

## üìù Overview

SggNet is a lightweight and efficient network for ORSI-SOD, achieving:
- **Parameters**: 2.70M
- **FLOPs**: 1.38G
- **Inference Speed**: 108 FPS

It demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight ORSI-SOD methods, delivering accurate saliency detection, sharper boundaries, and clearer activation maps.
